# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
This is for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Clients are interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine-learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. A clustering algorithm is used to group the cryptocurrencies, and data visualizations are used to share our findings with the board.
